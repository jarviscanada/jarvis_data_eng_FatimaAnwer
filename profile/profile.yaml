# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: To put myself in a few words, I am a detail-oriented, and an organized problem solver who loves to solve challenging real-world problems. I tend to go into the depths of a topic to master a skill. Some of my strengths include the ability to study the details of a new domain to develop sense of opportunities and challenges and sticking to the problem until it is solved. Collaborating with teams to deliver high quality work within assigned deadlines is something I really enjoy. Recently, I completed a Thesis-based Masters in Computer Science from the University of Regina. During my masters, I worked on an extensive Machine Learning project with an industry partner which involved executing the complete data science project lifecycle. Another interesting role I assumed was mentoring of undergraduate researchers at the university's Data Mining Research Lab. My deep passion to build applications for the software industry roots from the vision to make people independent and strong via technology and the impact it can have on their day to day lives. The best use of my skills would be to build technology for social good. I am looking to be part of a motivated team working with cutting-edge technologies where I can contribute to an organization's growth.

    description: Implemented a Linux clustering monitoring agent to monitor, collect and analyze data from host machines in a ten node cluster over a network in a PostgreSQL database provisioned using docker container using bash scripts and crontab to automate the script's execution. Created the SQL queries for analyzing the collected data for better business decisions and resources planning.
