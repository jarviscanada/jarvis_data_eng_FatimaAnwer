summary: I am detail-oriented, and an inquisitive problem solver who loves to build simple solutions for complex real-world problems. I completed my master's degree in Computer Science from University of Regina with a focus on data mining in March 2021. During my graduate studies, I worked on an end-to-end data science application that predicts the occurrences of forest fires using weather, historical fires, and geospatial data. Subsequently, I published my Thesis titled *FireInform - An Approach to Predict Hourly Forest Fire Occurrences using Multivariate Time Series Classification.* My experience has equipped me with an understanding of business requirements gathering, designing technical solutions, project management, implementing software, and communicating data driven insights to the management. The project was a joint venture with the Social Innovation Hub, ISM Canada. I also enjoyed mentoring undergraduate researchers at the Data Mining Research Lab. As an Applications and Data Engineer at Jarvis, I learnt tools and skills including but not limited to software design patterns, core Java programming, version control, building microservices, testing, and deployment. Collaborating within and across teams to address challenges at organizational or personal level helps me foster a productive work environment overall. I am quick learner who adapts to fast-paced work environments. One of my greatest drives to work in the software industry is the positive impact technology can have at a large scale for the social good. My passion lies in leveraging the power of data and cutting-edge technology to improve peoples lives on a day-to-day basis. In future, I plan to dedicate time to initiatives for Women and Girls in Tech.

    description: Implemented a Linux clustering monitoring agent to monitor, collect and analyze data from host machines in a multiple node cluster over a network in a PostgreSQL database provisioned using docker container using bash scripts and crontab to automate the script's execution. Created the SQL queries for analyzing the collected data for better business decisions and resources planning.

      - "Twitter App: Built an App that allows users to post, view, or delete Tweets from the Command Line Interface. The Application interacts with the Twitter REST API to send and receive HTTP Requests and Responses by using the HTTPClient and OAuth 1.0 libraries. Jackson library was used to serialize Java objects to JSON and vice versa. The App conforms to the MVC Design Pattern. Apache Maven was used to manage project dependencies and the app was deployed using Docker. Spring Framework was used to manage component dependencies"
      - "JDBC App: Developed a Java App to access a Postgres database using the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API. The instance of the Postgres database runs in a Docker container. Other technologies used include IntelliJ IDE and Maven for dependency management. The psql client tool is used to interact directly with the Postgres database instance in the terminal."
      - "Grep App: Developed a Java App that simulates the linux grep command searching for a specified text pattern in an input file. The App is implemented using Java I/O, such as FileReader, BufferedReader, FileWriter, and BufferedWriter, Functional Interfaces and Lambda Expressions. The project is built in IntelliJ using Maven. The App is Dockerized and pushed to Docker Hub."
  - name: "Springboot App"
    git_url: "/springboot"
    description: "Developed a Trading App with the microservice architecture and Springboot framework. The application allows users to manage client profiles and accounts, monitor portfolio performance, and trade securities. Java 8 and Springboot are used to implement the REST API which handles core business logic, such as managing trader profiles. The Springboot app fetches data from IEX Cloud which offers free market data (e.g. stock price) via its REST API. All data is persisted in a PostgreSQL database. Testing is performed using JUnit4 and Mockito."
