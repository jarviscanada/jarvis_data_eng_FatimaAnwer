# Fatima Anwer . Jarvis Consulting

To put myself in a few words, I am detail-oriented, and an organized problem solver who loves to build solutions for challenging real-world problems. I completed my master's degree in Computer Science from University of Regina with a focus on data mining in March 2021. As part of my graduate studies, I worked on an end-to-end data science application that predicts the occurrences of forest fires at hourly intervals using weather, historical fires, and geospatial data. Subsequently, I published my Thesis titled *FireInform - An Approach to Predict Hourly Forest Fire Occurrences using Multivariate Time Series Classification.* My experience has equipped me with an understanding of business requirements gathering, designing technical solutions, project management, implementing software, and communicating data driven insights to the management. The project was a joint venture with the Social Innovation Hub, ISM Canada. Another interesting role I assumed was mentoring undergraduate researchers at the Data Mining Research Lab. At Jarvis as a Data and Applications Engineer, I learned a bunch of new technologies and skills like software design patterns, core Java programming, version control, building microservices, testing, and deployment. Collaborating within and across teams to address challenges at organizational or personal level helps me foster a productive work environment overall. One of my greatest drives to work in the software industry is the positive impact technology can have at a large scale for the social good. My passion lies in leveraging the power of Data and cutting-edge technology to improve peoples lives on a day-to-day basis.

**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_FatimaAnwer/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Implemented a Linux clustering monitoring agent to monitor, collect and analyze data from host machines in a ten node cluster over a network in a PostgreSQL database provisioned using docker container using bash scripts and crontab to automate the script's execution. Created the SQL queries for analyzing the collected data for better business decisions and resources planning.
